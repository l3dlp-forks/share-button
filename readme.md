### Fork of Share-Button, reworked with A2 in mind
Love this idea, do not love the following:
- Boom! Download 2 more external fonts, woof!
- Destroy the button that I want to attach the Share stuff to, don't do that!

click listener is now on the $el you configure the plugin with, not the generated markup
